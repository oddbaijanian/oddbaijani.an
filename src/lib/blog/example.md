#### **The Lost One, Now and Forever**
Helplesness over tragedy destroys the ~~Foundation~~ of a mans being.
The *twirling* whirlwind of Frustration and an unchecked burst of Denial concludes A concoction of untainted terror unleashed upon our world.
Bitter-Sweetness of Regret fails and fades.
And Man resorts to an unhinged skeleton of Chaos - Reason Drowns in a bed of contaminated mud,
A Monstrous despot snatches Reason from its throne of supremacy. 
The sturdy that faces our long-winded gust of Depravity with Serenity deserves our utmost praise.
For the instability of a teetering intensity of passion can only be seperated by our most Gracious martyrs.
Graced with Reason, Tranquility and Understanding.
